# brawns_para_box
The one-time (self-crowned) champion of tiny mods returns with another small mod.  ((Don't use my first mod, Brawns Box, if you still have a copy of it with this mod!))

What this mod does is basically allows you to spawn certain hard-to-get items, for the cost of a trade-good and powered by a resource crafted from blood. Start by searching for 'strange sticks' and 'strange rocks', you'll need to carry a stick/rock to know what looks peculiar. Use those special simple materials, and make a 'wishing well', then you'll probably want to make a 'bloodletting set' and some 'gold/silver flat slugs' too. When powered with 'vitae', the well lets you trade your slug-coins for stuff!

In addition, I'm tacking some innawoods style stuff onto this mod, like tools, food, and the like. Currently included are (but not limited to in case I forget to mention it);
* A diesel-fueled jackhammer
* A tinderbox
* Tasty new food, forage porridge!

I've tested this out and it works just fine, but be warned; I can't guarantee it'll be stable/safe for all mods/games/saves. Use this at thy own peril!
