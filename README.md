The one-time (self-crowned) champion of tiny mods returns with another small mod.
===
What this mod does is basically allows you to spawn certain hard-to-get items, for a cost of a trade-good and powered by a resource crafted from blood. Included is a tool to allow you to harvest your own blood (it'd also probably work on bodies), some recipes to make the ingredients needed for your brand new wishing-well, and some more recipes to trade your brand new hand-made coins into juicy precious electronic materials and the like! 
===
I've tested this out and it works just fine, but be warned; I can't guarantee it'll be stable/safe for all mods/games/saves. Use this at thy own peril!
